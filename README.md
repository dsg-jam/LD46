# LD46

A Ludum Dare 46 game with the theme "Keep it alive".

## Ideas

- Planting crops and looking after them (Stardew Valley inspired)

- A machinery that needs coal and can be evolved (All credit goes to Factorio)

- A tower defense like, sci-fi game:

        The PLAYER crashes with his space ship on swampy (wooden) planet. His companion is a very valuable CHILD
        The PLAYER needs to protect and KEEP his companion ALIVE by placing turrets
        and using his personal weapon. In the beginning the players has only a weak droid-like turret.
        The enemies which can evolve with the time are trying to steal/kill the companion.
        The player needs to find new material to build better weapons and a better armor for himself but also for the companion.
        
        Inspired by 'The Mandalorian'
